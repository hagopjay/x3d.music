# Notice: licences and credits

Which folder carries which licence, and who must be credited. The leak sweep and the Truth witness read this file; a source missing here fails the build.

## By folder

| Path | Licence | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Code: `witnesses/`, `gen/`, `page/`, `audio/` (scripts and the Faust programs in `audio/faust/`), `score/` (scripts), `tools/`, `blender/`, `tracks/` (scripts), `.github/` | MIT (`LICENSE`) | Our own code |
| `sources/sonata11-3.krn` | CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 | Unmodified copy of the Humdrum encoding credited below |
| `score/turca.score.json`, `tracks/turca.*`, and every audio, frame and film derived from the *Alla Turca* score card | CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 | Adapted from the encoding credited below; share-alike applies to adaptations |
| `sources/ode-theme.musicxml`, `score/ode.score.json`, `tracks/ode.*` | MIT for the encoding; the melody is public domain | The theme is Beethoven's (1824), encoded by hand from the public-domain tradition |
| Audio made from the Ode card (`build/audio/ode/`, nothing sampled) | MIT; the melody is public domain | Synthesised in code from our own encoding |
| Audio made from the Turca card | CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 (the row above), and the piano's credit below travels with it | The piano is a recorded instrument; every other voice is synthesised |
| `docs/` | MIT | Our own text |

Commercial use of anything derived from the *Alla Turca* score card needs a fresh hand encoding of the 1878 edition (public domain) that does not use the file credited below. That is listed as longer-term work, not done.

## Credits

**Mozart, Piano Sonata in A major, K. 331 (300i), third movement, *Alla Turca*** (1783). The composition and the Alte Mozart-Ausgabe (Breitkopf & Härtel, 1878) are in the public domain. The digital encoding used here is:

> Digital edition of Mozart piano sonatas, from volume 20 of the Alte Mozart-Ausgabe (1878).
> Copyright (C) 2004-2018 Craig Stuart Sapp. https://github.com/craigsapp/mozart-piano-sonatas
> File `kern/sonata11-3.krn`, commit `0f1f49d`, licensed CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0).

Changes made: the file is parsed to note events with exact rational onsets and durations, repeats are expanded following the file's own repeat plan, and an arrangement layer (drums, bass, pads, brass, percussion) is added around the written notes. The written notes themselves are not altered.

**Beethoven, Symphony No. 9 in D minor, Op. 125, finale** (first performed 1824). Public domain. Text of *An die Freude* by Friedrich Schiller (1785), public domain.

**Salamander Grand Piano V3**, by Alexander Holm (a Yamaha C5 recorded at 48 kHz, 24 bit), remapped to SFZ and FLAC by kinwie: https://github.com/sfzinstruments/SalamanderGrandPiano. Licensed CC BY 3.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).
> Used: 17 keys (D#2 to D#6) at 8 of the 16 velocity layers, 136 FLAC files, 212 MB. Each file's size and sha256 are in `sources/salamander.manifest.json`; `tools/fetch_salamander.py` fetches and checks them, and nothing of the recordings is committed.
> Changes made: a note takes the nearest recorded key and is shifted by resampling by at most one semitone, the two layers either side of its velocity are blended, the start is trimmed to where the level first passes minus 50 dB under the recording's peak, and a release is added when the key goes up. The result is mixed with synthesised instruments, so what is heard is AI-made audio, not a recording of anyone playing the piece.
> The credit is in the metadata of every master file and on the listening page.

## Samples and tools

Listed as they are added. A sample library is named here with its licence and the commit or hash it was taken at before any audio made from it is published.

Our own code is MIT and calls pedalboard and DawDreamer at run time; this repository contains none of their code. What a licence like the GPL says about the sound those programs help make is a question this file does not settle (the audio carries no part of their code).

## AI-made material

Pictures, video and voices made with generative tools are labelled AI-made wherever they appear: the title card, the end credits and the caption of every shared still. Prompts and their sha256 hashes are in `docs/PROMPTS.md`.
